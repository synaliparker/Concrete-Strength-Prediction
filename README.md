**Course:** Feature Selection, Model Selection and Tuning - October 2020

**Score:** 52/60

## Project Summary
To analyze the various features at hand and predict the concrete strength. Implement the concepts of feature engineering and model tuning to increase the performance of the model.

### Skills and Tools
Cross Validation, Feature Engineering, Model Tuning, Regression techniques

## Project Description

### Objective:
To predict the concrete strength using the data available in file "concrete.csv". Apply feature engineering and model tuning to obtain a score above 85%.

### Attribute Information
Given are the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit, and a brief description. The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
